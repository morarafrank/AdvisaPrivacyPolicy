## Information We Collect

The App may automatically process limited non-personal information, including:
- Device type and operating system

- Crash and performance data

This information is collected in an aggregated or anonymized form.

We do not sell, rent, or share user information for advertising or marketing purposes.

## Third-Party Services

Advisa may rely on third-party services such as Google Play Services or analytics and crash-reporting tools. These services may collect information as governed by their own privacy policies and are used only to support app functionality and stability.

## Data Security

Reasonable measures are taken to protect information processed by the App. However, no method of electronic storage or transmission is completely secure, and absolute security cannot be guaranteed.

## Children’s Privacy

Advisa does not knowingly collect personal information from children under the age of 13. If such information is discovered, it will be removed promptly.

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the “Last updated” date will be revised accordingly.
